# Twitter Dapp Documentation

A Social Twitter Dapp


This website was generated with [Bonadocs](https://bonadocs.com/) using Docusaurus. It includes your smart contract
documentation with interactive widgets to help developers get started integrating quickly.

## Contract Deployment Addresses

| Contract Name | Arbitrum |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| TwitterDapp | 0xfE04242563E3570B0902174aa6A23F0912Fa1aA2 |

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

The `yarn start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/index.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
